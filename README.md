A simple tool that will hide that annoying Gravity Crash Handler automatically without messing with EAC.
The reason this tool exists its caused EAC its triggering invalid memory access exceptions, the reason why it does so i cant explain it publicly.
But if some WP staff member wants to know you can always contact me.

So since we dont have a fix for this yet, the best way to deal with this annoying bug its just to minimize it and hide it using Windows API.
