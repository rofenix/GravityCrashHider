A simply tool that will hide that annoying Gravity Crash Handler automatically without messing with EAC.
The reason this tool exists its caused EAC its triggering DX9 rendering problems, probably invalid allocations, its random but happens frequently and closing the dialog will result in closing the entire client. 
So the best way to deal with this annoying bug its just to minimize it and hide it using Windows API's.
